</h1>
<p>For centuries, humans have been captivated by the idea of creating machines that can think and learn like us. Philosophers, inventors, and storytellers have explored this vision, from the mechanical automata of ancient Greece to the artificial beings imagined in science fiction. Early inventors like Hero of Alexandria designed self-operating machines, and myths of artificial life—such as the golem or automatons—reflected humanity’s enduring fascination with intelligent systems. What was once the realm of imagination has now become reality in the form of <em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</em>, a transformative force reshaping industries, societies, and daily life.</p>
<p>AI is no longer a futuristic concept—it powers everything from recommendation systems and fraud detection to autonomous vehicles and generative AI (GenAI) models capable of producing text, images, and music. These advancements have been fueled by exponential growth in computational power, the availability of vast datasets, and breakthroughs in machine learning algorithms. At the heart of this revolution lies a class of models known as <em>neural networks</em>, the driving force behind deep learning.<br>
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Just as biological neurons connect to form intricate networks that process information, artificial neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that learn from data. This design enables them to recognize patterns, extract meaningful insights, and make predictions, making them particularly suited for problems involving <em>complex, high-dimensional, and unstructured data</em>—such as images, speech, and natural language. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which rely on handcrafted features, neural networks automatically discover representations in data, often outperforming classical approaches.</p>
<p>While deep learning—powered by advanced neural architectures—has made groundbreaking strides in areas like computer vision and language modeling, its foundation rests on simpler architectures. In this chapter, we focus on <em>feed-forward neural networks</em>, also known as <em>multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)</em>. These fundamental models serve as the building blocks for more sophisticated deep learning systems.</p>
<div id="why-neural-networks-are-powerful" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Why neural networks are powerful<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-neural-networks-are-powerful"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Neural networks excel in tackling <em>complex and nonlinear problems</em>, making them indispensable in modern AI applications. Their strengths stem from three key capabilities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Pattern recognition in complex data:</strong> Neural networks are exceptionally effective at identifying patterns in unstructured data, such as detecting objects in images, recognizing speech, and generating human-like text. These tasks often pose significant challenges for traditional algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness to noise:</strong> Due to their dense connectivity and adaptive learning, neural networks can extract meaningful information even from noisy or incomplete datasets, filtering out irrelevant variations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability and adaptability:</strong> Neural networks can handle massive datasets and model highly nonlinear relationships by adjusting their architecture—adding layers and neurons to capture increasing complexity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these advantages, neural networks come with challenges. Unlike interpretable models such as decision trees, they are often seen as <em>“black boxes”</em> because their decision-making process is distributed across many parameters, making it difficult to explain individual predictions. Additionally, training neural networks requires significant computational power, often necessitating specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs to process large volumes of data efficiently.</p>
<p>The power of neural networks lies in their ability to emulate biological learning. Just as neurons in the brain collaborate to recognize patterns, artificial neurons in a network combine their outputs to solve problems that traditional algorithms struggle with. This ability to adaptively model nonlinear relationships has placed neural networks at the forefront of both research and real-world applications.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Neural networks: inspired by biological neurons<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#neural-networks-inspired-by-biological-neurons"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The foundation of neural networks is deeply rooted in the structure and function of biological neurons, which form the basis of learning and decision-making in animal brains. While individual neurons are relatively simple in structure, their true power lies in their dense and intricate connectivity. These networks of interconnected neurons enable the brain to perform highly complex tasks, such as pattern recognition, classification, reasoning, and decision-making. For example, the human brain contains approximately <span class="math inline">\(10^{11}\)</span> neurons, with each neuron forming connections to an average of 10,000 others. This creates an astonishing <span class="math inline">\(10^{15}\)</span> synaptic connections—a vast, dynamic network capable of extraordinary learning and adaptation.</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by these biological structures. While they do not replicate the full complexity of the brain, they abstract key principles of learning through interconnected units. By leveraging dense networks of artificial neurons, ANNs can model nonlinear and dynamic processes, enabling them to tackle complex problems in domains such as image recognition, speech processing, and decision-making. They are particularly adept at uncovering patterns and relationships in data, even in cases where traditional algorithms struggle.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:net-brain">12.1</a>, a biological neuron is designed to process and transmit information. Dendrites act as input channels, collecting signals from other neurons. These signals are processed and integrated in the cell body, where a decision is made: if the combined input surpasses a certain threshold, the neuron “fires” and sends an output signal through its axon to other connected neurons. This nonlinear behavior—firing only when a certain input threshold is exceeded—plays a critical role in the brain’s ability to process information efficiently.</p>
<p>Similarly, an artificial neuron (illustrated in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:net-1">12.2</a>) emulates this process using a mathematical model. It receives inputs (<span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>) from either other artificial neurons or directly from a dataset. These inputs are combined using a weighted summation (<span class="math inline">\(\sum w_i x_i\)</span>), where the weights (<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>) represent the strength of each input’s influence. The combined signal is then passed through an activation function (<span class="math inline">\(f(.)\)</span>) to introduce non-linearity, determining the final output (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>). This output is either transmitted to other artificial neurons or used as the final result of the model. The activation function is crucial, as it enables neural networks to learn and model complex, nonlinear relationships in data.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of artificial neural networks is their ability to generalize from data, even when faced with noise or incomplete information. Unlike traditional algorithms that rely on explicit rule-based decision-making, neural networks distribute learning across many interconnected neurons and weighted connections, allowing them to adapt and identify patterns even when individual data points are imperfect. This distributed learning process enables them to handle complex, high-dimensional data more effectively than many conventional models.</p>
<p>However, this flexibility comes at a cost. Neural networks often require large amounts of data and computational power to train effectively, and their decision-making process is less interpretable than traditional models such as decision trees. Unlike rule-based models that provide clear decision paths, neural networks embed their learned knowledge within millions of parameters, making it challenging to understand precisely how a prediction is made.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mechanics of neural networks, starting with their core structure and the algorithms that enable them to learn from data.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-neural-networks-work" class="section level2" number="12.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> How neural networks work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-neural-networks-work"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Neural networks extend traditional linear models by incorporating multiple layers of processing to capture complex relationships in data. At their core, they build upon the fundamental concepts of linear regression. A linear regression model makes predictions using the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \dots + b_p x_p
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> represents the number of predictors, <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> is the intercept, and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b_p\)</span> are the learned coefficients. In this setup, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> is a weighted sum of the input features (<span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x_p\)</span>), where the weights (<span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b_p\)</span>) determine the relative influence of each feature on the prediction. This simple linear relationship can be visualized in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:net-reg">12.3</a>, where input features and the prediction are represented as nodes, with the coefficients acting as connecting weights.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:net-reg"></span>
<img src="images/ch12_net_reg.png" alt="A graphical representation of a regression model: input features and predictions are shown as nodes, with the coefficients represented as connections between the nodes." width="40%"><p class="caption">
Figure 12.3: A graphical representation of a regression model: input features and predictions are shown as nodes, with the coefficients represented as connections between the nodes.
</p>
</div>
<p>While linear models are effective for capturing direct relationships between inputs and outputs, they struggle to represent more complex patterns, such as interactions between variables or hierarchical structures in data. Neural networks address this limitation by introducing multiple layers of artificial neurons between the input and output, allowing them to model intricate, nonlinear relationships. This structure is illustrated in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:net-large">12.4</a>.</p>
<p>The architecture of a neural network consists of the following key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>input layer</strong> serves as the entry point for the data. Each node in this layer corresponds to an input feature, such as age, income, or pixel intensity in an image.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>hidden layers</strong> process the data by transforming inputs through multiple interconnected nodes (artificial neurons). Each hidden layer captures increasingly abstract features, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. Every neuron in a hidden layer is connected to neurons in both the preceding and succeeding layers, with each connection assigned a weight.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>output layer</strong> produces the final prediction. In classification tasks, it typically represents the probability of a given class, while in regression tasks, it outputs a continuous numerical value.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:net-large"></span>
<img src="images/ch12_net_large.png" alt="Visualization of a multilayer neural network model with two hidden layers." width="80%"><p class="caption">
Figure 12.4: Visualization of a multilayer neural network model with two hidden layers.
</p>
</div>
<p>In Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:net-large">12.4</a>, the input layer passes the features into the network, where each hidden layer applies transformations before passing the processed information forward. The output layer aggregates this information to generate the final prediction. Each connection in the network is assigned a weight (<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>), which determines the strength of influence one neuron has on another. These weights are adjusted during training to optimize the model’s accuracy.</p>
<p>The behavior of an artificial neuron can be mathematically expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{y} = f\left( \sum_{i=1}^{p} w_i x_i + b \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>where:<br>
- <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> represents the input features,<br>
- <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> represents the corresponding weights,<br>
- <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is a bias term that helps shift the activation threshold,<br>
- <span class="math inline">\(\sum\)</span> represents the summation of the weighted inputs,<br>
- <span class="math inline">\(f(.)\)</span> is the activation function, and<br>
- <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> is the output of the neuron.</p>
<p>A crucial component of this process is the activation function, which introduces non-linearity into the model. Without it, the neural network would be equivalent to a linear model, regardless of the number of layers. By applying a non-linear transformation to the combined input signals, activation functions allow neural networks to approximate complex relationships in data.</p>
<div id="key-characteristics-of-neural-networks" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Key characteristics of neural networks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-characteristics-of-neural-networks"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Despite the diversity of neural network architectures, all neural networks share three fundamental characteristics that define their functionality:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Activation functions</strong> The activation function transforms a neuron’s net input into an output signal that is passed to the next layer. Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns. Common choices include the sigmoid function, ReLU (rectified linear unit), and hyperbolic tangent (tanh).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network architecture</strong> The structure of a neural network defines its computational capacity. This includes the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and how neurons are connected. For example, deep neural networks contain many hidden layers, enabling them to learn hierarchical and abstract representations of data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training algorithm</strong> Training a neural network involves adjusting the weights (<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>) and biases (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) in the model to minimize prediction errors. This is achieved by defining a loss function, which quantifies how far the network’s predictions deviate from the true values. Optimization algorithms such as gradient descent iteratively update the weights to reduce this error, allowing the network to improve over time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the following sections, we will explore these components in greater detail, beginning with activation functions and their role in enabling neural networks to model complex, non-linear relationships.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="activation-functions" class="section level2" number="12.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> Activation functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#activation-functions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The activation function is a fundamental component of a neural network, determining how an artificial neuron processes incoming signals and passes information forward. Much like biological neurons, which integrate input signals from dendrites and decide whether to “fire,” artificial neurons use activation functions to introduce non-linearity, allowing neural networks to model complex relationships that linear models cannot capture. Without activation functions, even deep neural networks would behave like simple linear models, limiting their ability to learn hierarchical and abstract features from data.</p>
<p>In mathematical terms, an artificial neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> to determine its output:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{y} = f\left( \sum_{i=1}^{p} w_i x_i + b \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> represents the input features, <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> are the corresponding weights, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is a bias term, and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the activation function. The choice of activation function significantly impacts a network’s ability to learn and generalize.</p>
<div id="the-threshold-activation-function" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The threshold activation function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-threshold-activation-function"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Early neural network models used a simple threshold activation function, mimicking the binary nature of biological neurons. The threshold function activates only when the input exceeds a certain value, producing an output of either 0 or 1. It is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
0 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>This step-like behavior is visualized in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:active-fun-unit">12.5</a>. The function outputs 1 when the input is at least zero and 0 otherwise, making it useful for basic classification tasks.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:active-fun-unit"></span>

Figure 12.5: Visualization of the threshold activation function (unit step).
</p>
</div>
<p>While biologically intuitive, the threshold function has major drawbacks. It cannot model nuanced relationships between inputs and outputs, as it only provides binary decisions. More importantly, it is not differentiable, preventing its use in gradient-based optimization methods such as backpropagation. For these reasons, it has been largely replaced by continuous activation functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-sigmoid-activation-function" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The sigmoid activation function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-sigmoid-activation-function"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A widely used alternative is the sigmoid activation function, also known as the logistic function. The sigmoid function maps any real-valued input to a smooth output between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probability-based interpretations. It is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.72). The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve, as shown in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:active-fun-sigmoid">12.6</a>, and provides a differentiable alternative to the threshold function.</p>

<p>Although sigmoid activation is useful, it suffers from the <strong>vanishing gradient problem</strong>. When inputs are very large or very small, the function saturates, producing values close to 0 or 1. In these regions, the derivative is near zero, slowing down the learning process in deep networks. As a result, alternative activation functions are often preferred for hidden layers.</p>

<h3>Choosing the right activation function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-the-right-activation-function"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The choice of activation function depends on the network architecture and the specific learning task:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sigmoid</strong> is commonly used in the output layer for binary classification problems, where the output represents a probability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tanh</strong> is often used in hidden layers because it is zero-centered, which can lead to faster convergence during training.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ReLU</strong> is the default choice for hidden layers in deep networks due to its efficiency and ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Leaky ReLU</strong> is useful in cases where ReLU may cause neurons to become inactive, as it allows small negative outputs.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Linear activation</strong> is typically used in the final layer of regression models, where the output is a continuous value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activation functions such as sigmoid and tanh can suffer from <strong>saturation</strong>, where input values far from zero result in near-constant outputs. This leads to <strong>vanishing gradients</strong>, slowing down learning. One strategy to mitigate this issue is to preprocess input data through normalization or standardization, ensuring values remain within an optimal range.</p>
<p>ReLU and its variants have become the preferred choice for hidden layers in deep learning due to their computational efficiency and ability to propagate gradients effectively. However, selecting the right activation function depends on the specific problem and empirical evaluation.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.4</span> Network architecture<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#network-architecture"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The ability of a neural network to learn and make predictions is fundamentally tied to its architecture, or topology. This refers to the arrangement of neurons and the connections between them, which define how data flows through the network. While neural networks can take on various forms, their architecture is primarily characterized by three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of layers in the network,<br>
</li>
<li>The number of neurons (or nodes) in each layer, and<br>
</li>
<li>The connectivity between neurons across layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The architecture of a neural network determines its capacity to model complex relationships. Larger networks with more layers and neurons can capture intricate patterns and decision boundaries. However, the effectiveness of a network is not solely determined by its size but also by how its components are organized and interconnected.</p>
<p>To understand network architecture, consider a simple example illustrated in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:net-reg">12.3</a>. This basic network consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input nodes, which receive raw feature values from the dataset. Each input node corresponds to one feature and passes its value to the network.<br>
</li>
<li>Output nodes, which provide the network’s final prediction, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this single-layer network, input nodes are directly connected to the output node through a set of weights (<span class="math inline">\(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_p\)</span>), representing the influence of each input feature on the prediction. This simple architecture works well for basic classification or regression tasks but struggles with capturing complex patterns.</p>
<p>To address this limitation, additional layers can be introduced, as shown in Figure <a href="chapter-nn.html#fig:net-large">12.4</a>. These intermediate layers, known as hidden layers, allow the network to model nonlinear relationships and discover hierarchical structures in data.</p>
<p>A multilayer network typically consists of three types of layers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The input layer, where raw features enter the network.<br>
</li>
<li>One or more hidden layers, which extract and refine patterns.<br>
</li>
<li>The output layer, which combines the processed information to generate the network’s final prediction.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a fully connected network, each neuron in one layer transmits information to all neurons in the next layer, with an associated weight assigned to each connection. These weights determine how strongly neurons influence each other and are adjusted during training to optimize performance.</p>
<p>The introduction of hidden layers enables neural networks to process input data hierarchically. Early layers may learn basic features, such as edges in an image or simple word patterns in text, while deeper layers capture more abstract representations, such as object shapes or semantic meaning. Networks with multiple hidden layers are referred to as deep neural networks (DNNs), and training such models is known as deep learning. This approach has driven advancements in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.</p>
<p>The number of input and output nodes in a network is determined by the problem at hand.<br>
- The input nodes match the number of features in the dataset. For example, a dataset with 20 features would have 20 input nodes.<br>
- The output nodes depend on the task. In regression problems, there is typically one output node representing a continuous value. In classification tasks, the number of output nodes corresponds to the number of classes.</p>
<p>The number of hidden nodes in each layer is not predefined and must be determined based on the complexity of the problem. A larger number of hidden nodes increases the network’s ability to capture intricate patterns but also raises the risk of overfitting—where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Overly large networks can also be computationally expensive and slow to train.</p>
<p>Balancing network complexity and efficiency is essential for achieving optimal performance. This is often guided by the principle of Occam’s Razor, which suggests that the simplest model that adequately explains the data is usually preferable. In practice, the optimal network architecture is determined through experimentation, incorporating techniques such as cross-validation and regularization methods like dropout and weight decay to mitigate overfitting.</p>
<p>While this section focuses on fully connected networks, specialized architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data provide additional flexibility for specific tasks. These architectures build upon the principles of deep learning and have enabled major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>In summary, the architecture of a neural network defines its capacity to solve problems. From simple single-layer networks to sophisticated deep neural networks, these architectures offer the flexibility to model a wide variety of tasks, ranging from basic regression to highly complex applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In the next section, we will explore how these architectures are trained to optimize their performance and learn from data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">12.5</span> How neural networks learn<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-neural-networks-learn"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A neural network, like an untrained system, starts with no knowledge of the task at hand. Through exposure to data, it gradually learns by adjusting internal connections, a process akin to how humans refine their understanding through experience. These connections, represented as weights, are updated as the network processes data, enabling it to discover patterns and relationships over time. Just as a child learns to recognize objects by repeatedly encountering them, a neural network improves its predictions through iterative refinements based on the data it encounters.</p>
<p>Training a neural network is a computationally intensive process that involves adjusting the weights connecting neurons. While neural networks have been studied since the mid-20th century, their real-world application remained limited until the 1980s, when a major breakthrough—the backpropagation algorithm—made it feasible to train multilayer networks efficiently. Backpropagation revolutionized neural network training by enabling networks to systematically learn from errors, making deep learning practical for real-world applications. Despite being computationally demanding compared to simpler machine learning algorithms, backpropagation remains the foundation of modern neural network training, powering advancements in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing.</p>
<p>At its core, backpropagation refines the network’s weights through an iterative learning process consisting of two main phases: the forward phase and the backward phase. Each iteration, known as an epoch, begins with randomly initialized weights, as the network starts without prior knowledge. Over successive epochs, the network continuously updates its weights to minimize prediction errors.</p>
<p>In the forward phase, input data is passed through the network, layer by layer, from the input layer through any hidden layers before reaching the output layer. Each neuron processes its input by applying its associated weights, summing the weighted inputs, and transforming the result using an activation function. The output layer produces the network’s final prediction, which is then compared to the actual target value from the training data. This comparison generates an error signal, quantifying how far the network’s prediction deviates from the expected outcome.</p>
<p>In the backward phase, this error signal is propagated backward through the network to update the weights. The objective is to adjust the weights in a way that reduces the prediction error in subsequent forward passes. This process relies on gradient descent, an optimization technique that determines the optimal direction and magnitude of weight changes to minimize error. The gradient represents the rate of change of the error with respect to each weight, acting as a guide to indicate how adjustments should be made. This is analogous to descending a mountain: by always moving in the direction of the steepest downward slope, the network iteratively approaches the point of minimum error.</p>
<p>The magnitude of weight adjustments is controlled by a parameter known as the learning rate. A high learning rate enables the network to make large updates, which may speed up training but risks overshooting the optimal solution. Conversely, a low learning rate results in more gradual updates, ensuring precise refinements but potentially slowing convergence. Selecting an appropriate learning rate is crucial for efficient training, and modern optimization techniques, such as adaptive learning rate methods, help fine-tune this process dynamically.</p>
<p>To successfully apply gradient descent and backpropagation, the network’s activation functions must be differentiable. This requirement ensures that the gradients can be computed efficiently, allowing meaningful weight updates. As a result, smooth, non-linear activation functions such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are widely used in neural networks. In modern deep learning, variations of gradient descent, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam, have been developed to improve efficiency and stability, particularly for large-scale datasets.</p>
<p>Through repeated cycles of forward and backward propagation, the network refines its weights, reducing overall error and improving its ability to generalize to unseen data. While this process may seem computationally complex, modern machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch automate backpropagation, gradient descent, and weight updates, allowing practitioners to focus on designing the network architecture and preparing the data.</p>
<p>The development of backpropagation marked a turning point in neural network research, enabling these models to solve real-world problems with remarkable accuracy. Although training remains computationally demanding, advancements in hardware—such as GPUs and TPUs—have significantly accelerated the process, making it feasible to train large and complex networks efficiently. With a clear understanding of how neural networks learn, we now turn to their practical applications, examining how they uncover patterns in data to make accurate predictions in real-world settings.</p>

</h2>
<p>How can a financial institution improve the effectiveness of its future marketing campaigns? To make a data-driven decision, we analyze the bank’s previous marketing campaign to identify patterns that can inform future strategies. In this case study, we apply a neural network to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and campaign-related features. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover key factors that influence customer subscription behavior, helping the bank design more effective marketing strategies.</p>
<p>For this analysis, we use the <em>bank</em> dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset sourced from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a> and available in the <strong>liver</strong> package. This dataset was used by <span class="citation">Sérgio Moro, Paulo Cortez, and Paulo Rita<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Decision Support Systems&lt;/em&gt; 62 (2014): 22–31.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a></span> for a data-driven approach to predicting the success of bank telemarketing campaigns. The goal is to build a classification model that predicts which customers are likely to subscribe to a term deposit.</p>

<h3>Problem understanding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#problem-understanding-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Banks typically use two main strategies to market their financial products:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Mass campaigns</em>: These campaigns reach a broad audience with minimal targeting, often resulting in low response rates (typically below 1%).<br>
</li>
<li>
<em>Directed marketing</em>: This approach targets customers more likely to be interested in the product, improving conversion rates but raising potential privacy concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case study, we aim to enhance the effectiveness of directed marketing by analyzing past campaign data to identify patterns in customer behavior. By predicting which customers are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit, the bank can optimize marketing efforts, reduce costs, and minimize intrusive communications while maintaining success rates.</p>
<p>A term deposit is a fixed-term savings product that offers customers higher interest rates than standard savings accounts. Banks use term deposits to secure long-term funds and strengthen their financial reserves.

<h3>Preparing data for modeling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preparing-data-for-modeling-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Before training the neural network model, we need to prepare the dataset by splitting it into training and test sets. This ensures that we can assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. We use an 80/20 split, allocating 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. To maintain consistency with previous chapters, we apply the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/liver/man/partition.html">partition()</a></code> function from the <strong>liver</strong> package:</p>

<p>The <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html">set.seed()</a></code> function ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed. We use <code>train_set</code> to train the classification models, while <code>test_set</code> serves as unseen data for evaluation. The <code>test_labels</code> vector contains the true class labels for <code>test_set</code>, which we will compare against the model’s predictions.</p>
<p>To validate this split, we compare the proportion of <code>deposit = "yes"</code> in the training and test sets using a two-sample Z-test:</p>

<p>The test confirms that the proportions in both subsets are statistically similar (<em>p</em>-value &gt; 0.05), validating our split. This ensures that the training and test sets are representative of the original dataset, enabling us to evaluate the model’s performance effectively.</p>
<p>Our objective is to classify customers as either likely (<code>deposit = "yes"</code>) or unlikely (<code>deposit = "no"</code>) to subscribe to a term deposit, based on the following predictors:</p>
<p><code>age</code>, <code>default</code>, <code>balance</code>, <code>housing</code>, <code>loan</code>, <code>duration</code>, <code>campaign</code>, <code>pdays</code>, and <code>previous</code>.</p>

<h4>Feature scaling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feature-scaling-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Neural networks perform best when input features are on a similar scale. To achieve this, we normalize numerical variables using min-max scaling, transforming all inputs into a standardized range between 0 and 1. This prevents features with larger numerical ranges from dominating the learning process and helps improve model convergence.</p>
<p>To prevent data leakage, the scaling parameters (minimum and maximum values) are computed from the training set only and then applied consistently to the test set. This ensures that the test set remains an independent evaluation dataset, preventing it from influencing model training.</p>

<h3>Applying the neural network algorithm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#applying-the-neural-network-algorithm"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>To implement a neural network, we use the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neuralnet"><strong>neuralnet</strong></a> package in R. This package offers a straightforward and flexible way to build neural networks and provides functionality for visualizing the network topology. While <strong>neuralnet</strong> is a useful learning tool, it is also powerful enough for practical applications.</p>
<p>If the <strong>neuralnet</strong> package is not installed, it can be installed using <code>install.packages("neuralnet")</code>.Then, load it into the R session:</p>

<p>Next, we apply the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/neuralnet/man/neuralnet.html">neuralnet()</a></code> function to the training dataset to build our model:</p>

<p>Here’s what each argument in the function call does:</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>
<code>data</code>: Indicates the dataset used for training (<code>train_scaled</code>).<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>hidden = 1</code>: Defines the number of hidden layers and nodes (one hidden layer with a single node). For simplicity, we start with a minimal architecture, but more complex networks with additional nodes and layers may improve performance.<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>err.fct = "sse"</code>: Specifies the sum of squared errors as the loss function. While SSE is commonly used, cross-entropy loss (<code>ce</code>) is often preferred for classification tasks.<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>linear.output = FALSE</code>: Ensures that the output layer uses a logistic activation function, which is essential for classification tasks where the predicted values represent probabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>After training, we visualize the network to examine its topology:</p>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="12_Neural_Network_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>

<ul>
<li>9 input nodes, corresponding to the 9 predictors,<br>
</li>
<li>1 hidden layer containing a single node, and<br>
</li>
<li>2 output nodes representing the classification result (<code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The training process converged after 1998 steps, with a final error rate of 284.9. An analysis of the trained network’s weights indicates that <code>duration</code>—the length of the last phone call—has the strongest influence on the prediction. This finding aligns with prior studies, where call duration has been a key indicator of customer engagement in marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>This simple neural network model demonstrates how input features are processed through multiple layers to extract patterns and make predictions. In the next section, we will evaluate the model’s performance and interpret its results.</p>

<p>After training the neural network, we evaluate its performance by applying it to the test set, which contains customers unseen during training. The goal is to compare the model’s predictions with the actual class labels stored in <code>test_labels</code>.</p>
<p>To obtain predictions from the neural network, we use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html">predict()</a></code> function:</p>

<p>Each column represents one output unit. Since <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/neuralnet/man/neuralnet.html">neuralnet()</a></code> does not automatically apply a softmax function, the values should be interpreted as raw activations rather than probabilities. To classify a customer as likely to subscribe, we compare the output activations. If the activation corresponding to <code>deposit = "yes"</code> is greater than the activation for <code>deposit = "no"</code>, the customer is predicted as a subscriber.</p>
<p>We evaluate the predictions using a confusion matrix with a cutoff value of 0.5:</p>

<p>The confusion matrix summarizes the model’s performance by comparing predicted versus actual labels. It provides insight into classification accuracy, as well as the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.</p>
