# Preface {.unnumbered}  

Data science is transforming the way we solve problems, make decisions, and uncover insights from data. From generative AI chatbots—such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini—to personalized recommendations on Netflix and fraud detection in banking, data-driven techniques are revolutionizing industries. Whether you are new to data science or an experienced professional, *Data Science Foundations and Machine Learning Using R* provides an accessible, hands-on introduction to this exciting field—no prior analytics or programming experience required.  

This book is designed for those who want to understand data science and machine learning, as well as develop data-driven solutions for real-world applications. It provides a structured and accessible introduction to the fundamental concepts, making it suitable for beginners while also equipping readers with the skills to apply machine learning algorithms effectively. Whether you are a student, a business professional, or a researcher, this book offers a practical and intuitive approach to learning data science using **R**. Having taught these topics myself, I have found this hands-on approach to be highly effective and well-received by students.  

Unlike many theoretical texts, this book emphasizes a *learning-by-doing* approach. Each topic is introduced through step-by-step explanations, practical examples, and exercises—some worked out manually to build intuition, while others involve coding implementations in **R**. Readers will not only develop a solid theoretical foundation in machine learning and intelligent systems but also gain experience with widely used tools and techniques for applying these concepts in practice.  

The remainder of this preface outlines the book’s structure, how it can be used in different learning environments, and the foundational knowledge needed to get the most out of it.  

## Why This Book? {.unnumbered}  

Data science is a rapidly evolving field that integrates machine learning, statistical techniques, and computational tools to extract meaningful insights from data. This book provides a structured introduction to data analysis and machine learning using **R**, a powerful open-source programming language widely adopted for statistical computing, visualization, and predictive modeling.  

Unlike many textbooks that assume prior programming experience, this book is designed to be **intuitive and hands-on**, engaging readers through real-world applications to accelerate the learning curve. Concepts are introduced step by step and immediately applied to real datasets, reinforcing both theoretical foundations and practical skills. Readers will not only learn key data science techniques but also gain hands-on experience in solving analytical problems.  

Compared to proprietary software like SAS or SPSS, **R** offers a free, flexible, and highly extensible environment for data science. With its vast ecosystem of packages, **R** is a preferred choice for data mining, machine learning, and exploratory analysis across academia, industry, and research.

## How This Book Is Structured {.unnumbered}  

This book is designed as a *hands-on guide*, progressing from foundational concepts to more advanced machine learning techniques. Each chapter builds upon previous topics, ensuring a logical learning experience and reinforcing practical skills.  

To illustrate concepts effectively, we use *real-world datasets* (see Table \@ref(tab:data-table)), which are available in the **liver** package. These datasets make it easy for readers to follow along with examples and exercises. Below is an overview of the book’s chapters:  

- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-into-R)* – Introduction to **R**, including installation and essential functions.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-intro-DS)* – The foundations of data science and its methodology.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-data-prep)* – Techniques for cleaning and transforming data.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-EDA)* – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization and summary statistics.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-statistics)* – Fundamentals of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-modeling)* – Overview of machine learning models.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-knn)* – The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-evaluation)* – Model evaluation techniques and performance metrics.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-bayes)* – The Naïve Bayes classifier for probabilistic modeling.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-regression)* – Linear regression for predictive modeling.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-tree)* – Decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forests.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-nn)* – Introduction to neural networks.  
- *Chapter \@ref(chapter-cluster)* – Clustering techniques such as k-means.  

Each chapter concludes with *practical exercises* that reinforce key concepts and provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets. These exercises are designed to help readers apply what they’ve learned, deepening their understanding of data science and machine learning.  

## How to Use This Book {.unnumbered}
