# The Basics for R {#chapter-into-R}

Before you can analyze data, you need a way to communicate with your computer. Thatâ€™s where programming languages like R and Python come in. Many data science teams use a mix of languages, but R is a great starting point because it is designed specifically for data analysis and statistical computing.  

R offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools tailored for data science. It has a simple yet expressive syntax, making it easy to explore and manipulate data. Unlike general-purpose programming languages, R was built for statistical analysis, allowing data scientists to perform everything from basic calculations to advanced machine learning with just a few lines of code.  

Beyond its capabilities, R is:  

- Free & Open Source â€“ Available to everyone, with a vibrant community of contributors.  
- Cross-Platform â€“ Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
- Flexible & Powerful â€“ Supports interactive data exploration, visualization, and machine learning.  

While R is the language, RStudio is the tool that makes working with R easier. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides:  

- A console for running R commands,  
- A script editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion,  
- Built-in tools for data visualization, debugging, and package management.

## Getting Help and Learning More  

As you begin your journey with R, youâ€™ll likely encounter challenges and questions along the way. Fortunately, there are many resources available to help you troubleshoot problems, deepen your understanding, and continue learning. Whether you're stuck on an error message, exploring a new function, or looking for best practices, a combination of built-in documentation, online communities, and external learning materials can guide you.  

R comes with extensive built-in documentation that provides details on functions, packages, and programming techniques. To quickly look up a function, type `?` followed by the function name in the R console. This will bring up official documentation, including usage examples, argument details, and additional references. You can also use `help()` or `example()` to get more context on how a function works.  

Beyond Râ€™s internal help system, the R community is an invaluable resource. If you have a question, chances are someone has already asked (and answered) it. Platforms like Stack Overflow, RStudio Community, and the R-help mailing list contain thousands of discussions on common and advanced topics in R programming, data science, and machine learning. Searching these forums can often lead you to quick and reliable solutions. If you donâ€™t find an existing answer, posting your question with a clear explanation and a reproducible example will increase your chances of getting helpful responses.  

A simple Google search is often the fastest way to troubleshoot issues. Searching for an error message or function name will usually direct you to blog posts, documentation, or forum discussions with relevant explanations. Additionally, AI tools like ChatGPT can assist with R programming questions, debugging, and conceptual explanations. While AI-generated solutions arenâ€™t always perfect, they can provide useful insights, suggest alternative approaches, and help clarify difficult concepts.  

Ultimately, the best way to master R is through hands-on experience. Donâ€™t be afraid to experimentâ€”write code, test different functions, and explore new datasets. Mistakes are a natural part of learning, and each one helps reinforce your understanding. The more you practice, the more confident and proficient youâ€™ll become in R. Keep coding, keep exploring, and enjoy the journey!  

## Data Science with R  

R provides a strong foundation for data science, but its real power comes from its extensive ecosystem of packagesâ€”collections of functions, datasets, and documentation that extend Râ€™s capabilities. While the base version of R includes many essential tools, it does not come preloaded with all the statistical and machine learning algorithms you may need. Instead, these algorithms are developed and shared by a large community of researchers and practitioners as free and open-source R packages.  

A package is a modular, reusable library that enhances Râ€™s functionality. Packages include well-documented functions, usage instructions, and often sample datasets for testing and learning. In this book, we frequently use the **liver** package, which was developed specifically to accompany this book. It contains datasets and functions designed to illustrate key data science concepts and techniques. Additionally, for each machine learning algorithm covered in this book, we introduce and use the appropriate R packages that implement those methods.  

For those interested in exploring further, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) hosts thousands of packages for statistical computing, data visualization, and machine learning. The full list of available packages can be browsed on the [CRAN website](https://CRAN.R-project.org), providing access to tools tailored to various domains in data science and beyond.  

## How to Install R Packages {#install-packages}  

There are two ways to install R packages. The first method is through RStudioâ€™s graphical interface. Click on the "Tools" tab and select "Install Packagesâ€¦". In the dialog box that appears, enter the name of the package(s) you wish to install in the "Packages" field and click the "Install" button. Make sure to check the "Install dependencies" option to ensure that all necessary supporting packages are installed as well. See Figure \@ref(fig:install-packages) for a visual guide.  

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/RStudio-window-install} 

}

\caption{A visual guide to installing R packages using the 'Tools' tab in RStudio.}(\#fig:install-packages)
\end{figure}

The second method is to install packages directly using the `install.packages()` function. For example, to install the **liver** package, which provides datasets and functions used throughout this book, enter the following command in the R console:  


```r
install.packages("liver")
```

Press "Enter" to execute the command. R will connect to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and download the package in the correct format for your operating system. If you encounter any issues during installation, ensure you are connected to the internet and that your proxy or firewall is not blocking access to CRAN. The first time you install a package, R may ask you to select a CRAN mirror. Choose one that is geographically close to you for faster downloads.  

The `install.packages()` function also allows for customization, such as installing a package from a local file or a specific repository. To learn more, type the following command in the R console:  


```r
?install.packages()
```

Packages only need to be installed once. After installation, they must be loaded into each new R session using the `library()` function. We will cover how to load packages in the next section.  

## How to Load R Packages  

To optimize memory usage, R does not automatically load all installed packages. Instead, you must explicitly load the necessary packages in each new R session. This ensures that only relevant functions and datasets are available, minimizing resource consumption.  
To load a package, use the `library()` or `require()` function. These functions locate the package on your system and make its functions, datasets, and documentation accessible. For example, to load the **liver** package, enter the following command in the R console:  


```r
library(liver)
```

Press *Enter* to execute the command. If an error message appears stating that the package is not found (e.g., `"there is no package called 'liver'"`), it indicates that the package has not been installed. In such cases, refer to the previous section on installing packages.  

Beyond **liver**, this book utilizes several other R packages, which will be introduced progressively throughout the chapters as needed. However, some R packages contain functions with identical names. For instance, both the **liver* and **dplyr** packages include a `select()` function. When multiple packages are loaded, R defaults to using the function from the most recently loaded package.  

To explicitly specify which package a function should be sourced from, use the `::` operator. This ensures clarity and prevents conflicts. For example, to use the `select()` function from the **liver** package, enter:  

```r
liver::select()
```

This approach is particularly useful in complex projects where multiple packages are required, preventing unintended overwrites of functions with the same name.  

## Running R Code  

R is an interactive language, allowing you to type commands directly into the console and see the results immediately. For example, you can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To add two numbers, type the following in the R console:  


```r
2 + 3
   [1] 5
```

Press *Enter* to execute the command. R will compute the sum and display the result. You can also store this result in a variable for later use:  


```r
result <- 2 + 3
```

Here, `<-` is the assignment operator in R, used to assign values to variables. Some users prefer the `=` operator (`result = 2 + 3`), which also works in most cases, but `<-` remains the recommended convention in R programming.  

Variables in R store values for later use, allowing you to perform calculations efficiently. For example, you can multiply `result` by 4:  


```r
result * 4
   [1] 20
```

R will retrieve the stored value of `result` and compute the multiplication.  

### Using Comments in R {-}

Comments are used to explain your code and make it easier to understand. In R, a comment starts with `#`, and everything following it on that line is ignored by the interpreter.  


```r
# Store the sum of 2 and 3 in the variable `result`
result <- 2 + 3
```

Comments do not affect the execution of your code but are essential for documentation, especially when working on complex projects or collaborating with others.  

### Functions in R {#functions-in-r}

R provides a rich set of built-in functions to perform specific tasks. A function takes **input(s)** (arguments), processes them, and returns an **output**. For example, the `c()` function creates vectors:  


```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Create a vector
```

You can then apply functions to this vector. For example, to compute the average of the numbers in `x`, use the `mean()` function:  


```r
mean(x)  # Calculate the mean of x
   [1] 3
```

Functions in R follow a simple structure:  

```r
function_name(arguments)
```

Some functions require arguments, while others are optional. To learn more about a function, use `?` followed by the function name:  


```r
?mean  # or help(mean)
```

This will open Râ€™s help documentation, providing details about the function's purpose, usage, arguments, and examples.  

Functions are essential in R programming, helping to simplify complex operations and making code more reusable and efficient. As you progress, you will also learn how to write your own functions to automate tasks and improve workflow.  

## How to Import Data into R  

Before performing any analysis, you first need to load data into R. R can read data from multiple sources, including text files, Excel files, and online datasets. Depending on the file format and data source, you can choose from several methods for importing data into R.  

### Using RStudioâ€™s Graphical Interface  {-}

The easiest way to import data into R is through RStudioâ€™s graphical interface. Click on the *Import Dataset* button in the top-right panel of RStudio (see Figure \@ref(fig:load-data) for a visual guide). This will open a dialog box where you can choose the file type:  
- **From Text (base)** â€“ for CSV or tab-delimited files.  
- **From Excel** â€“ for Microsoft Excel files.  
- Other formats are available, depending on installed packages.  

After selecting your file, RStudio will display an import settings window (see Figure \@ref(fig:load-data-2)). Here, you can adjust column names, data types, and other options. If the first row contains column names, select *Yes* under the *Heading* option. Click *Import*, and the dataset will appear in RStudioâ€™s Environment panel, ready for analysis.  

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/RStudio-window-data-1} 

}

}

\caption{A visual guide to customizing the import settings when loading a dataset into R using the 'Import Dataset' tab in RStudio.}(\#fig:load-data-2)
\end{figure}

### Using `read.csv()`  {-}

You can also import data directly using the `read.csv()` function, which reads tabular data (such as CSV files) into R as a data frame. If your data file is stored locally, you can load it as follows:  


```r
data <- read.csv("path/to/your/file.csv")
```

Replace `"path/to/your/file.csv"` with the actual file path. If your file does not contain column names, use:  


```r
data <- read.csv("path/to/your/file.csv", header = FALSE)
```

### Setting the Working Directory  {-}

By default, R looks for files in the current working directory. If your data is located elsewhere, you can specify the full path in `read.csv()` or set the working directory.  

To check your current working directory:  


```r
getwd()
```

To set a new working directory:  


```r
setwd("~/Documents")  # Adjust the path based on your system
```

Alternatively, in RStudio, go to *Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory...* and select the desired folder.  

### Using `file.choose()` with `read.csv()`  {-}

To interactively select a file instead of typing its path manually, use `file.choose()`:  


```r
data <- read.csv(file.choose())
```

This will open a file selection dialog, making it a convenient option when working with multiple datasets.  

### Loading Data from Online Sources  {-}

R also allows direct import of datasets from web sources. For example, to load a publicly available COVID-19 dataset:  


```r
corona_data <- read.csv("https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv", 
                        na.strings = "", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
```

This approach is useful for accessing open datasets from research institutions or government agencies.  

### Using `read_excel()` for Excel Files  {-}

To import Excel files, use the `read_excel()` function from the **readxl** package. First, install and load the package:  


```r
install.packages("readxl")

library(readxl)
```

Then, import the Excel file:  


```r
data <- read_excel("path/to/your/file.xlsx")
```

Unlike `read.csv()`, `read_excel()` supports multiple sheets within an Excel file, which can be specified using the `sheet` argument.  
### Loading Data from R Packages {-}

Some datasets are available directly in R packages and do not require importing from an external file. For example, the **liver** package, developed for this book, contains multiple datasets. To access the *churn* dataset:  


```r
library(liver)
data(churn)
```

Since many of the datasets used in this book are included in the **liver** package (see Table \@ref(tab:data-table)), we will frequently use this package for examples and demonstrations.  

This section is well-structured and clearly explains the fundamental data types in R. It is concise and informative, making it accessible to beginners while maintaining a professional tone suitable for a Springer publication. Below are some minor refinements to improve clarity, consistency, and readability.

## Data Types in R  

Data in R can take various forms, and correctly identifying these types is essential for effective data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Each data type has specific properties that determine how R processes it, so understanding them helps avoid errors and ensures accurate results.  

Here are the most common data types in R:  

- **Numeric**: Represents real numbers, such as `3.14` or `-5.67`. This type is used for continuous numerical values, like heights, weights, or temperatures.  
- **Integer**: Represents whole numbers without decimals, such as `1`, `42`, or `-10`. This type is useful for count-based data, such as the number of customers or items sold.  
- **Character**: Represents text or string data, such as `"Data Science"` or `"R Programming"`. This type is commonly used for categorical labels, names, and descriptive values.  
- **Logical**: Represents Boolean values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Logical data is often used in conditional statements and filtering operations.  
- **Factor**: Represents categorical data with predefined levels. Factors are commonly used for storing variables such as `"Male"` or `"Female"` in a dataset and are particularly useful in statistical modeling.  

To check the data type of a variable, use the `class()` function. For example, to determine the type of the variable `result`, type:  


```r
class(result)
   [1] "numeric"
```

Press *Enter*, and R will display the variableâ€™s data type.  

Recognizing different data types is essential for choosing the right analytical and visualization techniques. As we will explore in later chapters (e.g., Chapters \@ref(chapter-EDA) and \@ref(chapter-statistics)), numerical and categorical variables require different approaches when performing descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.  

## Data Structures in R  

Data structures are fundamental to working with data in R. They define how data is stored and manipulated, which directly impacts the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis. The most commonly used data structures in R are vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:load-data-2).  

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/R-objects} 

}

\caption{A visual guide to different types of data structures in R.}(\#fig:R-objects)
\end{figure}

### Vectors in R {-} 

A vector is the simplest data structure in R. It is a one-dimensional array that holds elements of the same type (numeric, character, or logical). Vectors are the building blocks of other data structures. You can create a vector using the `c()` function:  


```r
# Create a numeric vector
x <- c(1, 2, 0, -3, 5)

# Display the vector
x
   [1]  1  2  0 -3  5

# Check if x is a vector
is.vector(x)
   [1] TRUE

# Check the length of the vector
length(x)
   [1] 5
```

Here, `x` is a numeric vector containing five elements. The `is.vector()` function confirms that `x` is indeed a vector, while `length(x)` returns the number of elements in the vector.

### Matrices in R {-}  

A matrix is a two-dimensional array where all elements must be of the same type. Matrices are useful for mathematical operations and structured numerical data. You can create a matrix using the `matrix()` function:  


```r
# Create a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns
m <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Display the matrix
m
        [,1] [,2] [,3]
   [1,]    1    2    3
   [2,]    4    5    6

# Check if m is a matrix
is.matrix(m)
   [1] TRUE

# Check the dimensions of the matrix
dim(m)
   [1] 2 3
```

This matrix `m` consists of two rows and three columns, filled row-wise. The `dim()` function returns the dimensions of the matrix. To fill the matrix column-wise, set `byrow = FALSE`. 

### Data Frames in R {-}  

A data frame is a two-dimensional table where each column can contain a different data type (numeric, character, or logical). This makes data frames ideal for storing tabular data, similar to spreadsheets. You can create a data frame using the `data.frame()` function:  


```r
# Create vectors for student data
student_id <- c(101, 102, 103, 104)
name       <- c("Emma", "Bob", "Alice", "Noah")
age        <- c(20, 21, 19, 22)
grade      <- c("A", "B", "A", "C")

# Create a data frame from the vectors
students_df <- data.frame(student_id, name, age, grade)

# Display the data frame
students_df
     student_id  name age grade
   1        101  Emma  20     A
   2        102   Bob  21     B
   3        103 Alice  19     A
   4        104  Noah  22     C
```

This data frame `students_df` consists of four columns: `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `grade`. The `class()` function confirms that an object is a data frame, while `is.data.frame()` checks its structure.

To inspect the first few rows of a data frame, use the `head()` function. For example, to display the first six rows of the *churn* dataset from the **liver** package:


```r
library(liver)  # Load the liver package
data(churn)     # Load the churn dataset

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(churn)
   'data.frame':	5000 obs. of  20 variables:

```

This code loads the **liver** package, retrieves the *churn* dataset, and provides an overview of its structure. The `str()` function is particularly useful for summarizing data frames, as it displays data types and column values.

### Lists in R {-}

A list is a flexible data structure that can contain elements of different types, including vectors, matrices, data frames, or even other lists. Lists are useful for storing complex objects in a structured way. You can create a list using the `list()` function:  


```r
# Create a list containing a vector, matrix, and data frame
my_list <- list(vector = x, matrix = m, data_frame = students_df)

# Display the list
my_list
   $vector
   [1]  1  2  0 -3  5
   
   $matrix
        [,1] [,2] [,3]
   [1,]    1    2    3
   [2,]    4    5    6
   
   $data_frame
     student_id  name age grade
   1        101  Emma  20     A
   2        102   Bob  21     B
   3        103 Alice  19     A
   4        104  Noah  22     C
```

This list `my_list` stores a vector, a matrix, and a data frame within a single object. Lists allow for efficient organization of heterogeneous data. To explore the structure of a list, use the `str()` function:


```r
str(my_list)
   List of 3
    $ vector    : num [1:5] 1 2 0 -3 5
    $ matrix    : num [1:2, 1:3] 1 4 2 5 3 6
    $ data_frame:'data.frame':	4 obs. of  4 variables:
     ..$ student_id: num [1:4] 101 102 103 104
     ..$ name      : chr [1:4] "Emma" "Bob" "Alice" "Noah"
     ..$ age       : num [1:4] 20 21 19 22
     ..$ grade     : chr [1:4] "A" "B" "A" "C"
```

Lists are powerful tools in R, especially for handling nested or hierarchical data. For further exploration, use `?list` to access the documentation and additional examples.

## Accessing Records or Variables in R

Once you've imported data into R, you can easily access specific records or variables using the `$` and `[]` operators. These tools are essential for extracting data from data frames and lists.

The `$` operator allows you to extract a specific column from a data frame or a specific element from a list. For example, to access the `name` column in the `students_df` data frame, you would use:


```r
students_df$name
   [1] "Emma"  "Bob"   "Alice" "Noah"
```

This command retrieves and displays the `name` column from the `students_df` data frame.

Similarly, you can use the `$` operator to access elements within a list. For example, to access the `vector` element in the `my_list` list:


```r
my_list$vector
   [1]  1  2  0 -3  5
```

This command retrieves and displays the `vector` element from the `my_list` list. The `$` operator is a straightforward and powerful way to access specific variables or elements within data frames and lists.

Another method for accessing specific records or variables is through the `[]` operator, which allows you to subset data frames, matrices, and lists based on specific conditions. For example, to extract the first three rows of the `students_df` data frame, you can use:


```r
students_df[1:3, ]
     student_id  name age grade
   1        101  Emma  20     A
   2        102   Bob  21     B
   3        103 Alice  19     A
```

This command will display the first three rows of the `students_df` data frame. 

You can also use the `[]` operator to extract specific columns. For instance, to select the `name` and `grade` columns from the `students_df` data frame:


```r
students_df[, c("name", "grade")]
      name grade
   1  Emma     A
   2   Bob     B
   3 Alice     A
   4  Noah     C
```

This command retrieves and displays only the `name` and `grade` columns from the `students_df` data frame.

The `[]` operator is versatile, enabling you to subset data frames, matrices, and lists with precision. Both the `$` and `[]` operators are fundamental tools for data manipulation in R, allowing you to efficiently access and manage the data you need.

## Visualizing Data in R  

Data visualization is a powerful tool for exploring and communicating insights from data. It plays a crucial role in exploratory data analysis (EDA), which we will delve into in Chapter \@ref(chapter-EDA). As the saying goes, "a picture is worth a thousand words," and in data science, this is especially true. R provides a broad array of tools for creating high-quality plots and visualizations, allowing you to effectively present your findings.  

In R, there are two primary ways to create plots: using base R graphics and using the **ggplot2** package. Base R graphics offer a simple and direct way to generate plots, while **ggplot2** provides greater flexibility and customization. This book primarily uses **ggplot2**, as it follows a structured approach based on the _grammar of graphics_, which breaks down plots into three key components:  

- Data: The dataset to be visualized, which should be in a data frame format when using **ggplot2**.  
- Aesthetics: The visual properties of the data points, such as color, shape, and size.  
- Geometries: The type of plot to be created, such as scatter plots, bar plots, or line plots.  

To create a plot using **ggplot2**, first install and load the package. Instructions for installing packages are provided in Section \@ref(install-packages). To load **ggplot2**, use the following command:  


```r
library(ggplot2)
```

Next, define the data, aesthetics, and geometries for your plot. For example, to create a scatter plot of miles per gallon (`mpg`) versus horsepower (`hp`) using the built-in *mtcars* dataset:  


```r
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp))
```



\begin{center}\includegraphics{Intro-R_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-32-1} \end{center}

This code initializes the plot with the `ggplot()` function, specifying the dataset (`mtcars`). The `geom_point()` function adds points to the plot, and the `aes()` function maps `mpg` to the x-axis and `hp` to the y-axis.  

The general template for creating plots with **ggplot2** follows this structure:  


```r
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

Using this template, a variety of visualizations can be created.

### Geom Functions in ggplot2  {-}

Geom functions determine the type of plot created in **ggplot2**. Some commonly used geom functions include:  

- `geom_point()` for scatter plots  
- `geom_bar()` for bar plots  
- `geom_line()` for line plots  
- `geom_boxplot()` for box plots  
- `geom_histogram()` for histograms  
- `geom_density()` for density plots  
- `geom_smooth()` for adding smoothed conditional means to plots  

For example, to create a smoothed line plot of `mpg` versus `hp`:  


```r
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp))
```



\begin{center}\includegraphics{Intro-R_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-34-1} \end{center}

Multiple geom functions can be combined in a single plot. To overlay a scatter plot on the smoothed line:  


```r
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp))
```



\begin{center}\includegraphics{Intro-R_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-35-1} \end{center}

Alternatively, the `aes()` function can be placed inside `ggplot()` to streamline the code:  


```r
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_point()
```

Additional visualization examples can be found in Chapter \@ref(chapter-EDA). For a complete list of geom functions, refer to the [**ggplot2** documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).  

### Aesthetics in ggplot2 {-}

Aesthetics control the visual properties of data points, such as color, size, and shape. These properties are specified within the `aes()` function. For example:  


```r
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = cyl))
```



\begin{center}\includegraphics{Intro-R_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-37-1} \end{center}

Here, `color = cyl` maps the color of the points to the number of cylinders (`cyl`) in the **mtcars** dataset. **ggplot2** automatically assigns a unique color to each category and adds a corresponding legend.  

In addition to `color`, other aesthetics such as `size` and `alpha` (transparency) can be used:  


```r
# Left plot: using the size aesthetic
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp, size = cyl))

# Right plot: using the alpha aesthetic
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp, alpha = cyl))
```


\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Intro-R_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-38-1} \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Intro-R_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-38-2} 

Aesthetics can also be set directly inside geom functions. For example, to make all points blue triangles of size 3:  


```r
ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp), 
             color = "blue", size = 3, shape = 2)
```



\begin{center}\includegraphics{Intro-R_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-39-1} \end{center}

This section introduced the fundamentals of data visualization in R using **ggplot2**. The next chapters will explore how visualization plays a crucial role in exploratory data analysis (Chapter \@ref(chapter-EDA)) and how to refine plots for communication and reporting. For more details on visualization techniques, see the [**ggplot2** documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). For interactive graphics, consider exploring the **plotly** package or **Shiny** for web applications.  

## Formula in R {#sec-formula-in-R}

Formulas in R provide a concise and intuitive way to specify relationships between variables for statistical modeling. They are widely used in functions for regression, classification, and machine learning to define how a response variable depends on one or more predictors.  

In R, formulas use the tilde symbol `~` to express relationships between variables, where the response variable appears on the left-hand side and predictor variables on the right-hand side. For example, the formula `y ~ x` specifies that `y` is modeled as a function of `x`. When there are multiple predictors, they are separated by `+`.  
For instance, using the `diamonds` dataset, the formula:


```r
price ~ carat + cut + color
```

models the `price` of a diamond based on its `carat`, `cut`, and `color`.  

To include all other variables in the dataset as predictors, we can use the shorthand notation:


```r
price ~ .
```

This approach is particularly useful in large datasets where listing all predictors manually would be impractical.

A formula in R acts as a **quoting operator**, instructing R to interpret the variables symbolically rather than evaluating them immediately. The variable on the left-hand side of `~` is the **dependent variable** (or response variable), while the variables on the right-hand side are the **independent variables** (or predictor variables).

::: {.example #ex-formula}
To illustrate, suppose we want to predict the `price` of a diamond using a linear regression model. We can pass the formula into the `lm()` function:


```r
model <- lm(price ~ carat + cut + color, data = diamonds)
```

Here, the formula `price ~ carat + cut + color` defines the relationship, and the `data` argument specifies the dataset to use.
:::

Once defined, formulas can be used in various R functions for statistical modeling and machine learning. As you progress through later chapters, you will encounter formulas in functions for regression, classification, and more (e.g., Chapters \@ref(chapter-knn), \@ref(chapter-bayes), and \@ref(chapter-regression)). Mastering formula syntax will enable you to efficiently build, customize, and interpret models throughout this book.

## Reporting with R Markdown  

Thus far, this book has covered how to interact with R and RStudio for data analysis. This section focuses on an equally important aspect: effectively communicating analytical findings. Data scientists must present results clearly to teams, stakeholders, and clients. Regardless of the depth of an analysis, its impact is limited if it is not communicated effectively. R Markdown facilitates this process by enabling the seamless integration of code, text, and output into dynamic, reproducible reports.  

R Markdown allows users to write and execute R code within a document, producing reports, presentations, and dashboards. It employs Markdown, a lightweight markup language designed for ease of reading and writing. This entire book was written in R Markdown, with all source files available on GitHub. R Markdown streamlines report generation, ensuring that text, code, and visualizations remain synchronized as data changes.  

R Markdown documents can be exported into multiple formats, including HTML, PDF, Word, and PowerPoint, making it adaptable to various audiences and reporting needs. Furthermore, it supports the creation of interactive documents using Shiny, allowing users to build web applications that facilitate exploratory data analysis.  

To get started, the following resources provide useful references:  

- **R Markdown Cheat Sheet**: The [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) offers a concise reference for creating documents, including syntax, formatting, and output options. It is available in RStudio under *Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet*.  
- **R Markdown Reference Guide**: The [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) provides a detailed overview of R Markdownâ€™s features, including document structure and customization.  

### R Markdown Basics {-}

R Markdown follows a literate programming approach, combining text and executable code in a single document. Unlike word processors where formatting is visible during writing, R Markdown requires compilation to generate the final report. This approach ensures automation, as plots and figures are generated dynamically and inserted into the document. Since the code is embedded, analyses are fully reproducible.  

To create an R Markdown document in RStudio:  

<p style="font-family: serif">
    File > New File > R Markdown
</p>

A dialog box will appear, allowing the selection of a document type. For a standard report, choose "Document." Other options include "Presentation" for slides, "Shiny" for interactive applications, and "From Template" for predefined formats. After selecting the document type, enter a title and author name. The output format can be set to HTML, PDF, or Word; HTML is often recommended for debugging.  

R Markdown files use the `.Rmd` extension, distinguishing them from `.R` script files. A newly created file contains a template that can be modified with custom text, code, and formatting.  

### The Header  {-}

The header defines metadata such as the documentâ€™s title, author, date, and output format. It is enclosed within three dashes (`---`).  

```yaml
---
title: "An Analysis of Customer Churn"
author: "Reza Mohammadi"
date: "Aug 12, 2024"
output: html_document
---
```

- **Title**: The documentâ€™s title.  
- **Author**: The name of the author.  
- **Date**: The date of creation.  
- **Output format**: The format of the final document (`html_document`, `pdf_document`, or `word_document`).  

Additional metadata can be included for customization, such as table of contents options and formatting preferences.  

### Code Chunks and Inline Code  {-}

R Markdown integrates R code within documents using code chunks, which are enclosed in triple backticks (` ```{r} `) followed by the code. For example:  

````markdown

```r
2 + 3
   [1] 5
```
````

When compiled, R executes the code and displays the output within the document. Code chunks are used for analysis, visualizations, and modeling. The "Run" button in RStudio allows individual execution of chunks. See Figure \@ref(fig:run-chunk) for a visual guide.  

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/run-chunk} 

}

\caption{Executing a code chunk in R Markdown using the 'Run' button in RStudio.}(\#fig:run-chunk)
\end{figure}

Common chunk options include:  

- `echo = FALSE`: Displays output but hides the code.  
- `eval = FALSE`: Shows the code but does not execute it.  
- `message = FALSE`: Suppresses messages.  
- `warning = FALSE`: Suppresses warnings.  
- `error = FALSE`: Hides error messages.  
- `include = FALSE`: Omits both code and output.  

For inline calculations, use backticks and the `r` keyword:  

```markdown
The factorial of 5 is 120.
```

This renders dynamically as:  

~~~
The factorial of 5 is 120.
~~~

### Styling Text  {-}

R Markdown supports various text formatting options:  

- **Headings**: Use `#` for section titles.  
- **Bold**: Enclose text in double asterisks (`**bold**`).  
- **Italic**: Use single asterisks (`*italic*`).  
- **Lists**: Use `*` for bullet points.  
- **Links**: `[R Markdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)`  
- **Images**: `![Alt text](path/to/image.png)`  

For mathematical notation, use LaTeX-style equations:  

```markdown
Inline: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$  
Block: $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$
```

### Mastering R Markdown {-}

    - `Age` (numeric)  
    - `Ratio` (Sodium/Potassium ratio)  
    - `Type` (a factor with three levels: `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`)  
     
    Run the code and report the summary statistics of the data.  


```r

n2 = 60          # Number of patients with drug B 
n3 = n - n1 - n2 # Number of patients with drug C

# Generate Age variable between 15 and 75
Age = sample(x = 15:75, size = n, replace = TRUE)

# Generate Drug Type variable with three levels
Type = sample(x = c("A", "B", "C"), size = n, replace = TRUE, 
              prob = c(n1, n2, n3))

# Generate Sodium/Potassium Ratio based on Drug Type
Ratio = numeric(n)

Ratio[Type == "A"] = sample(x = 10:40, size = sum(Type == "A"), 
                            replace = TRUE)
Ratio[Type == "B"] = sample(x =  5:15, size = sum(Type == "B"), 
                            replace = TRUE)
Ratio[Type == "C"] = sample(x =  5:15, size = sum(Type == "C"), 
                            replace = TRUE)

# Create a data frame with the generated variables
drug_data = data.frame(Age = Age, Ratio = Ratio, Type = Type)
```

Visualize the data using the following **ggplot2** code:  


```r
ggplot(data = drug_data, aes(x = Age, y = Ratio)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Type, shape = Type)) + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Sodium/Potassium Ratio", 
       x = "Age", y = "Sodium/Potassium Ratio")
```

22. Extend the dataset `drug_data` by adding a new variable named `Outcome`, which is a factor with two levels (`"Good"` and `"Bad"`).  
    - Patients with `Type == "A"` should have a higher probability of `"Good"` outcomes.  
    - Patients with `Type == "B"` and `Type == "C"` should have a lower probability of `"Good"` outcomes.  
    - Use `sample()` with appropriate probabilities to generate the `Outcome` variable.
