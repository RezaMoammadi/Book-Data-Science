# Welcome {-}

Following an ancient Persian idiom, the title of this book is “Eating the Liver of Data Science” which could be interpreted as “getting intimately close with data science”. The purpose of the book is to introduce non-experts (business analysts etc.) to the world of data science. The aim is therefore that the content is easily accessible to individuals who may not necessarily have a strong background in either mathematics or programming. We will largely avoid deep technical development, focusing primarily on key concepts and applications. However, we will include references to more advanced material for the interested reader, and some short “starred” sections which will include a small amount of mathematical detail which can be skipped by less advanced readers.

), 'packages.bib')
